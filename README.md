Library management database systems are software solutions that help libraries organize and manage their resources and services more efficiently. They consist of several key components, including a cataloging module allowing easy creation, editing, and classification of library materials. The issue register module manages the borrowing, returning, and renewing of items by borrowers/customers, a customer management system that handles registration, authentication, and record-keeping. 
The benefits of using a library management database system are numerous. They include improved efficiency by automating routine tasks and reducing administrative overhead, enhanced access to library resources for patrons, streamlined operations through centralized management of library materials and transactions, and data-driven decision-making by empowering librarians to make informed choices based on usage data and analytics. 
In conclusion, modern libraries require a library management database system to optimize their operations, improve resource access, and deliver high-quality services to patrons.
The Library management system consists of five tables - Book, Author, Publisher, Customer & IssueRegister
